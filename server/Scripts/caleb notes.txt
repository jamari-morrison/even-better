	-any non-standard dev practices? any built test cases i should follow the style for? (dont see any) YEP
	-should i go ahead and write tests for everything? i think after i get one it'll be easy to do the rest 
	-what is built? - figma lmao
	-what should i build first? - figma lmao
	-test coverage = auto regression tests + material ui coverage (test what classes are present based on params) YEP 
	-critical findings in npm YEP



in apps they have vr test, that's where chromatic is



test cases:
params

-make sure things are as modular as possible

-don't test icon

to test: textfield (select is still WIP), button, checkbox, rating (still in WIP)
build out more of the design before 






dashboard to view insights, mod how data is collected, set up emails

findings:
select's default value is '' but it still displays a value (so maybe have standard of having the default be "Select..."?)
select doesn't respect defaultvalue prop
